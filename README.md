Hardware modelling using verilog

Various codes of Combinational and Sequential Circuits can be found here.

I have used iverilog simulation tool. It is an open source free tool. 

To simulate type the following command : iverilog -o <any_Word> example.v example_tb.v

Then type the command : vvp <any_word>
To see the outputs.
